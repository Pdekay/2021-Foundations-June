            <h3>Mobile Web Dev</h3>
            This course is designed as a direct follow-up to the Basic Web Development
            course, but is open to anyone with an existing, solid knowledge of
            HTML & CSS. The primary topic of this course is learning how to make
            web sites that perform and look great on mobile devices AND desktop
            devices. You'll start by taking the project from the basic course and
            getting it to look great on mobile without affecting the desktop version.
